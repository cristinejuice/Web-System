    <h3>Women in Basket</h3>
    <p> Anita Magsaysay-Ho was a Filipino artist known for depicting rural life and the struggles of working-class 
        women in the Philippines. "Women in a Basket" exemplifies this theme. The painting portrays women in traditional
        attire seated in a basket suspended from a bamboo pole carried by two men. The muted colors and serene expressions
        on the women's faces suggest the difficulties of their work but also the strength and resilience of their spirits. <br>

        The painting may have been inspired by Magsaysay-Ho's observations of daily life in the Philippines, 
        where women often work in physically demanding jobs. The image of women being "carried" in baskets is a 
        common one in Filipino culture, and Magsaysay-Ho likely drew on this symbolism. Overall, "Women in a Basket"
        is a powerful artwork that celebrates the dignity and strength of working-class women in the face of hardship.</p>
